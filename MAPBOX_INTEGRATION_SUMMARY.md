# Mapbox Location Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Mapbox for precise location selection in both registration (ProfileSetup) and profile editing (EditProfile) pages. The implementation provides users with an interactive map, search functionality, and the ability to select precise coordinates.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- `@mapbox/mapbox-gl-geocoder` - For location search/autocomplete
- `react-map-gl` - React wrapper for Mapbox GL JS
- `@types/mapbox-gl` - TypeScript types for Mapbox

### 2. New Components Created

#### **MapboxLocationPicker** (`src/components/MapboxLocationPicker.tsx`)
A reusable component that provides:
- Interactive Mapbox map with click-to-select location
- Geocoding search box for location lookup
- Geolocation button to use device location
- Visual marker display for selected location
- Returns location data as: `{ address: string, latitude: number, longitude: number }`

### 3. Helper Functions (`src/lib/locationHelpers.ts`)
Created utility functions to handle both legacy (plain string) and new (JSON) location formats:
- `getLocationAddress()` - Extracts the address string from either format
- `getLocationCoordinates()` - Extracts coordinates from JSON format (returns null for legacy format)

### 4. Updated Pages

#### **ProfileSetup.tsx** (Registration)
- Replaced simple Input field with MapboxLocationPicker
- Updated location state to store JSON object with address and coordinates
- Modified database insert to stringify location JSON

#### **EditProfile.tsx** (Profile Editing)
- Replaced simple Input field with MapboxLocationPicker
- Added backward compatibility to parse old string-format locations
- Updated database update to stringify location JSON

#### **Profile.tsx** (Profile Display)
- Updated to use `getLocationAddress()` helper to display location correctly

#### **Search.tsx** (Search/Filter)
- Updated location filtering to use `getLocationAddress()` helper
- Updated location display in search results
- Updated location matching logic for scoring

#### **UserMap.tsx** (Map Display)
- Updated to parse new JSON location format
- Now prioritizes coordinates from JSON over geocoding
- Falls back to geocoding for legacy string-format locations
- Updated popup display to show correct address

### 5. Styling Updates (`src/index.css`)
Added comprehensive custom styles for Mapbox components:
- Geocoder search box styling (matches app design system)
- Map control button styling
- Popup styling
- Dark mode support for all Mapbox components

### 6. Documentation Updates (`README.md`)
- Added Mapbox to technology stack
- Added environment variable configuration instructions
- Included link to obtain Mapbox token

## Environment Variable Required

Add to your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
```

Get your token from: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/

**Note:** The app will display an error message if the token is not configured, but won't crash.

## Data Format

### New Location Format (JSON)
```json
{
  "address": "123 Main St, City, Country",
  "latitude": 52.3676,
  "longitude": 4.9041
}
```

### Legacy Format (Plain String)
```
"Amsterdam, Netherlands"
```

**Backward Compatibility:** The implementation automatically handles both formats. Legacy string locations will:
1. Display correctly (extracted as address)
2. Be geocoded on-the-fly in UserMap component
3. Be upgraded to new format when user edits their profile

## Features

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Search**: Users can type a location name and select from suggestions
2. **Map Selection**: Users can click anywhere on the map to set their location
3. **Geolocation**: One-click button to use device's current location
4. **Visual Feedback**: Selected location shows a pin marker
5. **Address Display**: Reverse geocoding shows human-readable address

### Technical Benefits
1. **Precise Coordinates**: Locations now include exact lat/lng coordinates
2. **Better Mapping**: UserMap component can display user locations more accurately
3. **Improved Search**: Location-based filtering is more accurate
4. **Scalable**: Easy to add distance-based features in the future

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Registration flow with location selection
- [ ] Profile editing with location update
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing profiles
- [ ] Location display on profile pages
- [ ] Location filtering in search
- [ ] UserMap display with new locations
- [ ] Dark mode styling for all Mapbox components
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness of map interface

## Future Enhancements

Potential features that are now possible with precise coordinates:
1. Distance-based search ("Find helpers within 10km")
2. Radius filtering on map
3. Route directions between users
4. Location-based recommendations
5. Heatmap of user distribution

## Notes

- The Mapbox token in UserMap.tsx should ideally be moved to environment variables for production
- Consider implementing rate limiting for geocoding API calls
- Map style can be customized via `mapStyle` prop (currently using `streets-v12`)
- Geocoder can be configured with additional options like country bias, language, etc.
